AI RAG Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that combines the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources for more accurate, context-aware, and reliable answers.

🚀 Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for knowledge-grounded responses

Integrates with vector databases for efficient document search

Context-aware conversations with memory support

Customizable knowledge base (upload your own documents/data)

Built with Python + LangChain + OpenAI API / Hugging Face models

Simple interactive interface (CLI / Streamlit / Gradio)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language Model: OpenAI GPT / Hugging Face Transformers

Retrieval: FAISS / Pinecone / ChromaDB

Frameworks: LangChain, SentenceTransformers

Frontend (optional): Streamlit / Gradio

⚡ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aachcoder47/rag-chatbot.git
cd ai-rag-chatbot

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the chatbot
jupyter notebook
# open notebook.ipynb and run cells


(or if you build a UI: streamlit run app.py)

📖 Usage

Add documents to the data/ folder.

The chatbot will index them into a vector store.

Ask questions — it will retrieve the most relevant chunks and generate precise answers.

🌟 Example

User: "What is RAG in AI?"
Bot: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an architecture that enhances LLMs with external knowledge sources by retrieving relevant documents and grounding responses in facts."

🔮 Future Improvements

Add multi-turn conversation memory

Support for multiple vector databases

Deploy as a web app with Streamlit
